## üìù Overview

This plugin allows you to convert [PlantUML diagrams](https://plantuml.com/) into [Astah](https://astah.net/products/astah-professional/), and vice versa:

- Import PlantUML diagrams into Astah Professional
- Export Astah diagrams as PlantUML text

## üíª Requirements

- [Astah Professional](https://astah.net/products/astah-professional/), [Astah UML](https://astah.net/products/astah-uml/) v10.0 or later
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) runtime environment
  - On **Windows**, no separate installation of PlantUML or Graphviz is needed because Graphviz is bundled with PlantUML.
  - On **non-Windows OS**, to generate class diagrams or statemachine diagrams, [Graphviz](https://plantuml.com/graphviz-dot) must be installed manually.

If the plugin doesn't work, try [installing PlantUML manually](https://plantuml.com/starting).

## üì¶ How to install

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [Releases](https://github.com/ChangeVision/astah-plantuml-plugin/releases)
2. Launch Astah and drag & drop the `.jar` file into Astah's window
3. Restart Astah and create a new project. If you see a "PlantUML View" tab in the bottom-right pane, installation is complete.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to use

After installing the plugin, the "PlantUML View" tab will appear with a PlantUML editor on the left and a preview pane on the right.

- `‚ñ≤toAstah` generates diagrams and models in Astah from PlantUML text
- `‚ñºtoPlant` exports the current Astah diagram to PlantUML format with preview
- Syntax checking runs continuously and displays errors at the bottom
- Ctrl + scroll zooms both the editor and the preview

### üîÑ Conversion Specifications

#### üì• From PlantUML to Astah (`‚ñ≤toAstah`)

When importing PlantUML diagrams into Astah, a new diagram is always created.

However, if a blank diagram is already open in the Diagram Editor and its type matches the PlantUML diagram being imported, the elements will be added to the existing open diagram instead of creating a new one.

If the PlantUML code includes multiple diagrams (defined between @startuml and @enduml), each will be imported as a separate diagram in Astah.

#### üì§ From Astah to PlantUML (`‚ñºtoPlant`)

When exporting diagrams from Astah to PlantUML, the output is **fully regenerated** every time.
The export does not merge with or update any previously generated PlantUML code.

### About Plugin Behavior and Generated Content

This plugin internally uses temporary files to display and convert diagrams written in PlantUML within Astah.  
However, it does not provide any functionality for users to directly save or export diagrams as image or text files.

According to the [PlantUML FAQ](https://plantuml.com/faq), the content of diagrams generated using PlantUML (whether textual or visual) is considered **the user‚Äôs own work** and is **not subject to the GPL or other license restrictions** . Therefore, it may be used freely.
