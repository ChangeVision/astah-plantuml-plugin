# Astah PlantUML Plugin

## Overview

This plugin allows you to convert [PlantUML diagrams](https://plantuml.com/) into [Astah](https://astah.net/products/astah-professional/), and vice versa:

- Import PlantUML diagrams into Astah Professional
- Export Astah diagrams as PlantUML text

## Requirements

- [Astah Professional](https://astah.net/products/astah-professional/) v9.0 or later
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) runtime environment
  - On **Windows**, no separate installation of PlantUML or Graphviz is needed because Graphviz is bundled with PlantUML.
  - On **non-Windows OS**, to generate class diagrams or statemachine diagrams, [Graphviz](https://plantuml.com/graphviz-dot) must be installed manually.

If the plugin doesn't work, try [installing PlantUML manually](https://plantuml.com/starting).

## How to install

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [Releases](https://github.com/ChangeVision/astah-plantuml-plugin/releases)
2. Launch Astah and drag & drop the `.jar` file into Astah's window
3. Restart Astah and create a new project. If you see a "PlantUML View" tab in the bottom-right pane, installation is complete.

## How to use

After installing the plugin, the "PlantUML View" tab will appear with a PlantUML editor on the left and a preview pane on the right.

- `▲toAstah` generates diagrams and models in Astah from PlantUML text
- `▼toPlant` exports the current Astah diagram to PlantUML format with preview
- Syntax checking runs continuously and displays errors at the bottom
- Ctrl + scroll zooms both the editor and the preview

### Conversion Specifications

#### From PlantUML to Astah

- On the first conversion, a new diagram will be created in Astah.
- From the second time onward, new elements will be **merged** into the existing diagram. Existing elements will be **left unchanged**, and deleted items in the PlantUML text will be **ignored**.
- Only **new classes** are added; updating attributes or operations in existing classes will not be reflected.
- If multiple diagrams are described (multiple `@startuml` ~ `@enduml` blocks), each one will be imported as a separate diagram. However, if the order or type of diagrams is changed afterward, updates may not work correctly.

#### From Astah to PlantUML

- The output will be **fully regenerated** every time; no merge is performed.
